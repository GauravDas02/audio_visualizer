# audio_visualizer

AI has indeed come a long way in accelerating and developing front-end applications. In this scenario, I try to create an audio visualizer front-end application, within one-day, using AI code generation and using my knowledge to debug and arrange the code properly.

This implementation has been made using the **Next.js** framework with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript.

# Implementation

To run it locally, simply take a pull from the repository to your local. Start your terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project. Then, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

If instead, you would like to use yarn instead of npm as your package manager. Then please run the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

**Note 1**
Oops! I do indeed see that there is a missing requirements.txt file! Be assured that it will be updated pretty soon!

**Note 2**
You need to specifically pass a base64 encoded music or audio sequence in the code to be able to use the 'Sample Audio' option
